## We are an organisation who wants to encourage newbies on Github to come and take part in open-source projects and contribute more on Github (well, the clue's in the name ðŸ˜‰)

## There's plenty to take part in the organisation. Here's some of our repositories: 

- ### [DSA](https://github.com/MakeContributions/DSA) - Data Structure and Algorithm (DSA) contributions
- ### [markdown-dungeon](https://github.com/MakeContributions/markdown-dungeon) - A dungeon made fully out of markdown.
- ### [ideahub](https://github.com/MakeContributions/ideahub) - A collection of ideas and projects that contain from beginner to advance :octocat: ðŸŽ¯ðŸš€

## One of our maintainers can add you to the organisation once you contribute if you wish to join, and you could be part of the growing community of over 200 members.
